Feature: Activity Phase, Step 2 (Region) -- Claim Hex

# Your surveyors fully explore the hex and attempt to add it
# into your kingdom's domain. Spend 1 RP and then attempt a
# basic Exploration, Intrigue, Magic, or Wilderness check.
#
#
# Critical Success
#     You claim the hex and immediately add it to your
#     territory, increasing your kingdom's Size by 1
#     (this affects all statistics determined by Size;
#     see page 532).
#
#     Your occupation of the hex goes so smoothly that
#     you can immediately attempt another Region activity.

    Scenario: Claim Hex critically succeeds
        Given the kingdom Aryc at level 1
        And the kingdom's size is 7
        And the kingdom has 2 RP
        And the kingdom has 100 XP
        And a die roll of 20
        When I Claim Hex with Magic
        Then there are 2 requirements
        And "mark the hex 0.0 as claimed" is a requirement
        And "you may take another region activity" is a requirement
        And the kingdom's size went up to 8
        And RP went down to 1
        # FIXME: the XP increase is size-dependent,
        # and this is incorrect for level 1.
        #
        # For V&K's rules:
        #    Size          XP/hex
        #    ----          ------
        #    1-9           100
        #    10-24          50
        #    25-49          25
        #    50-99          10
        #    100+            5
        #
        # RAW: always 10 XP.
        And XP went up to 125

# Success
#     You claim the hex and add it to your territory,
#     increasing your kingdom's Size by 1 (this affects
