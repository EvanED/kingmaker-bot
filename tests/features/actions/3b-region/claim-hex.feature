Feature: Activity Phase, Step 2 (Region) -- Claim Hex

# Your surveyors fully explore the hex and attempt to add it
# into your kingdom's domain. Spend 1 RP and then attempt a
# basic Exploration, Intrigue, Magic, or Wilderness check.
#
#
# Critical Success
#     You claim the hex and immediately add it to your
#     territory, increasing your kingdom's Size by 1
#     (this affects all statistics determined by Size;
#     see page 532).
#
#     Your occupation of the hex goes so smoothly that
#     you can immediately attempt another Region activity.
