Feature: Reconnoiter Hex

# I'm leaving this unimplemented for now.
#
# The reason is that I'm interpreting the DC for this activity to
# be the same DC the players would face if in a hex, rather than
# the kingdom's Control DC, which is used for every other roll.
#
# I don't really have a good mechanism for the DM to provide this
# information, so it would be a pretty manual process anyway,
# especially given the outcome of this.
